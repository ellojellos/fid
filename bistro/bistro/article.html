<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vaccum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Holondaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30th.</p>
